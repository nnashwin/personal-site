    <h2>Why Automation Sucks (and how to make it better).</h2>
    <p>The concept of automation is not new to the software industry.  Since there have been flaky builds and mission-critical features, there has been the need to define software that can test it and report the results to humans.</p>
    <p>Automation was new to me when I worked at my first corporate job.  Having done front-end development for a few years prior, I was familiar with feature-focused development.  Running in the quality space was totally new.</p>
    <p>After working on automation for a few months, it became clear that writing correct, reliable automation can be difficult to implement.  Flaky tests, distributed codebases, and lack of time / resource investment leads to many automation test suites that break due to extraneous issues every time someone wants to merge into master.</p>
    <p>Developer skill is important to writing valuable tests.  {More importantly}, maintaining and redefining tests as systems change is often deprioritized for new features with promises of increased revenue. In a few previous positions, automation fell by the wayside and only amounted to functional code coverage numbers with tests that didn't reflect the health of the system.</p>
    <p>More recently, I have had the opportunity to help a couple of friends automate a project that has been easier to manage.  We started out by <b>defining a clear goal for the task we are automating</b>. The smaller scale, focus on customer satisfaction (the person whose task is helping to automate) over coverage numbers, and bringing in an outside tester (me) to hammer the system has led to the development of a stable, healthier automation suite.</p>
    <h3>Automation is just testing</h3>
    <p>Automation in the software industry is usually referring to either build automation, task automation, or test automation.  The latter has become a trend in recent years (and maybe before, I don't have context here) as companies push for software teams to write code faster while trying to maintain quality.  Automation testing of APIs and UI components is a hot topic, and many companies have jumped behind it with gusto.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>But like most things in computing, automation by itself does not solve your problem. The coolest automated testing architecture with multiple suites, parallel tests, and easy-to-use test writing tools (I'm looking at you Gherkin)</p>
    <p>Due to trends in the industry, many large companies jump behind automation as the solution for all of their defect problems.  Tasking engineers to write automation tests with new features they add, this is another case of expecting the tool to solve the problem.</p>
    <p>Citing automation tools as solutions to defects may look good on paper. Letting go of the majority of quality assurance people within the company in order to cut costs may help you make budget for this year.  Company owners should know, however, that swinging too far to the automation direction and expecting engineers to write code, unit tests, and valuable automation tests will often result in larger costs long-term.</p>
    <h3>Engineers have bias</h3>
    <p>Even the most effective engineers have a subconscious bias when writing code.  In the same way that professional authors send their manuscripts to editors, there will always be a bias towards what you create.</p>
    <p>This bias may be negligible, but it is often easy for an engineer to dismiss edge cases in a piece of software s/he has written with a casual "no one will use it that way".  When writing applications that need to have low amounts of defects, you must have a group of people trying to break the product.</p>
    <p>Having trained professionals who look to break a product can do well to harden core features you develop. If quality is dire for your business, it is important that you maintain a solid number of these people to "wreck shit".</p>
    <p>Only when you employ shit wreckers can you isolate, solve, and write tests for edge cases that encompass large features in your software.</p>
    <h3>Birth of the Automation Queen</h3>
    <p>Finding engineers who are willing to solely work on automation may prove difficult.  However, making maintenance of a product's automation pipeline and testing everyone's problem tends to make it no one's problem. In favor of deadlines and "more interesting work", I have seen engineers often put automation and quality low on their list of priorities.  So low, in fact, that the automation task might give Virgil a run for his money when {finish Dante reference here}.</p>
    <p>If one engineer on a team is on automation and related tools full time, it can prove to be more manageable.  Depending on the amount of freedome you give him or her, Delving deep into the dark arts of automation can also be fun for the engineer who can focus on writing solid tests and breaking the application.</p>
    <h3>The Fang Paradox</h3>
    <p>I had a co-worker who recently passed away. He had written automation tests for multiple years before I knew him.  Since we worked hand and hand with software engineers, there were often small conflicts as to the degree of testing we should do and how this should affect development velocity.  I remember a debate he, another solid engineer, and I had at a dinner party once.</p>
    <p>Having worked as both a Quality Engineer and a Software Engineer building features, he was of the opinion that if you can only use one set of tests to have confidence of the health of a system, they should be automation tests.  His argument was that testing a system hollistically is really the most important part.  He mentioned that he didn't really care what the independent units did as long as the system was functioning properly.</p> 
    <p>I didn't want to accept this at first, and tried to find reasons to support my beliefs.  People have always told me that unit tests and test driven development are really important. If you test all of the units independently and they all work, then the whole of the system should work too, right?.</p>
    <p>Wrong.  Although unit testing and other tests are helpful and proven to reduce bugs, <u>the most important quality of a system is that it works correctly</u>.  In the business world, the definition of correctness should is that it solves a business need. A system with 0 bugs (hypothetical) written in the sexiest framework and programming language that doesn't solve a problem is a useless system.</p>
    <p>Using more lower-level (unit) tests can help mitigate performance issues and lead to cleaner code. The correct working of a system is still more important.</p>
    <p>We build software to do the right things.  Automation should be used to test that the core functionality of your software is stable in a variety scenarios as the development cycle continues.</p>
    <h3>Lack of Investment = Lip Service</h3>
    <p>Reliable automation doesn't just need planning.  If you want automation tests that stay updated and have purpose, you need people who are dedicated to maintaining them.</p>
    <p>When I say dedicated, I'm not talking about the ephemeral pictures that are put up all over you office building with eagles and wild horses running off into the mountains.  Dedicated engineers are engineers whose main job is to ensure automation of systems is reliable AND valuable.  They need to work closely with devs who are building features to ensure that they are testing the most important functionality of a system.</p>
    <p>What tends to happen in a lot of companies is what I call "chap stick" automation.  You spread a bit of automation into everyone's work requirements.  Everyone says that they are writing and maintaining solid automation, but since it's everyone's duty, it ends up as no one's duty.</p>
    <p>Upper management tends to focus on velocity over automation and uses coverage numbers to fill each level on the way up with a sense of false security.  In reality, many engineers either write fake tests / turn off test suites in order to get new releases out or give out automation as bitch work to college interns, contractors, or new hires.</p>
    <p>It's not that engineers don't care about quality.  You <b>must have people thinking on improving the quality of a system full time</b>.  Or at least the majority of the time. 10% focus on automation doesn't cut it.</p>
    <p class="tldr-block"><b>TL;DR:</b> Automation is only as useful as the task you automate.  It needs a large time investment to stay updated. It doesn't always add value.</p>
