    <h2>Incremental Learning</h2>
    <small>2020-06-18</small>
    <p>During my school years I forgot how to learn.  I lost the ability to teach myself.</p>
    <p>Each year I felt like I was on some kind of obsessive treadmill.  While school was in, I looked forward to the weekend or vacation.  When vacation happened, I binged on video games or television until boredom set in.  Once bored, I looked forward to learning or exploring.  I never found a way out.</p>
    // I HAVE EDITED UNTIL HERE
    <p>As my school years dragged on, I felt that something was wrong with me.  I felt like I wasn't smart enough or curious enough to succeed.</p>
    <p>Following this loss, my love for life also diminished.  A feeling of hopelessness crawled into the back of my head.  In high school, I spent many a plan-less Friday night grappling with a feeling of anxiety.  It felt like the whole world was passing me by and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  I couldn't figure out what to do.</p>
    <h3>A First Taste</h3>
    <p>After high school, I wanted to become great at something.  It didn't matter what that thing was.  I stumbled onto Chinese when I joined the military and wanted to be as great as I possibly could.</p>
    <p>You could say that by that point in time I had the rage to master.  I prefer to think that I was a teenager who was looking for any way possible to build my self-confidence.  I spent 3 years immersing myself as much as I could and experienced relatively good results.</p>
    <p>However, I felt a nagging fear in the back of my mind that what I was learning was temporary.  If I let up on learning for any substantial period of time, I would lose everything I had.  Like a corrupt senator using insider trading information to maintain the millions that he has, I grasped at each new word I tried to learn and often felt my memory was slipping on things I had learned much earlier in the past.</p>
    <h3>A Dip into the Deep End</h3>
    <p>At that time I met a person who would change my life.</p>
    <p>Have you ever found people in your life who seem to be destined to play a major role?  Like the meeting of Jack Black and Kenny in the Tenacious D movie, these people seem to have been written into your story from the beginning.  This friend of mine was not only a good friend to hang out with, but he also was years ahead on a journey of self-learning I had yet to begun.</p>
    <p>Through a blog and his mentorship, I began the journey on the road to using Incremental Learning that has continued until today.</p> 
    <h3>What is Incremental Learning?</h3>
    <p>Incremental Learning can be defined as a method of learning that helps a student convert all forms of learning material into durable and lasting memories.  Utilizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>, a student is be reminded of specific pieces of information at exact points of time when they are most beneficial to the consolidation of long-term memory. The student then makes decisions as to how important this information is to their future goals and incrementally processes the information into an ultimate testable format (usually a question and answer pair or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze deletion</a>.</p>
    <p>The full process of incremental learning occurs in a few steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1. Inserting full articles into your spaced repetition app of choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2. Each time the review of the article comes up, you take at least one action on the text.  An action can be deleting text that you deem not important for your long-term memory / goals, saving an entire section of the article into a separate card in order to process later, or immediately creating a testable card (question answer pair or cloze) immediately to be processed later.</p>
            <p>It might not sound like it's beneficial, but there is a incredible benefit to learning when you do your reading on a spaced schedule.  Even if you are only reading a bit of an article at a time, you will remember more of the whole text than it seems and will have the ability to slowly condense your understanding into question answer pairs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3. As the cards you formulate are comprised of smaller and smaller chunks of texts from the full articles, you will eventually whittle these cards down to simpler materials.  Once a card is only comprised of one memory, you can transform it into a format that requires testing yourself in order to pass the card.</p>
            <p>By this time, this active recall card will be lodged in your long-term memory and the interval on which you review it will increase slowly.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Challenge of Prioritization</h3>
    <p>Because incremental learning does take time, we really have to be selective on what information we decide to keep stored in our long-term memory.  Once I realized how much I can remember and learn solidly using this process, I tried to remember everything I could, from college curriculum to Chinese to poems.</p>
    <p>I was partially successful in this endeavor, but long-term I needed to delete a lot of that information due to it not being as important to my long-term goals.  The actual amount of information we can store in long-term memory is ultimately limited to an extent, and it is much less than what we learn in an actual class in the classroom.  Incremental Learning is playing the long game, so you might not get the best grades in a math class if you are dedicating all of your time to formulating and remembering what you learned for your lifetime.</p>
    <p>If you keep the material from the class in your collection, you will remember this information 10 years later though.  So you might not be getting 100s on all your tests, but the 85 - 95s you do get will stick in your memory as long as you continue to do your reviews and keep the information in your collection.</p>
    <h3>The Biggest Investment</h3>
    <p>The biggest difficulty in using Incremental Learning to power your studying is in the consistency that is required to benefit from the process.  To really benefit from the scheduling, you must do your cards daily.  You don't need to always finish (although it is ideal if you do), but the method works best if you make it a habit you perform every day to some extent.</p>
    <p>When many people start on the journey, they add tons of cards to their collections and try to force themselves to go from spending no time studying in this manner to studying hours a day.  This is a great way to burn out, and I almost quit doing cards because of this many times in my past.  Most Spaced Repetition programs have a method to limit the amount of reviews you do a day.  If you find yourself drowning in reviews, it is best to use this limiting method to a number that is manageable in your schedule.  It is better to push yourself a little bit outside of your comfort zone daily than a lot outside of your comfort zone weekly.  Eventually those small pushes will feel like nothing, and you will need to push harder in order to feel the same sense of exertion.</p>
    <p>Using Incremental Learning daily for a long enough time will supercharge your life, work, and interests in knowledge.  However, it takes time.</p>
    <h3>One Thing You Must Remember during this Process</h3>
    <p>The best learning in life comes with a sense of pleasure.  If you feel like you are struggling or not enjoying your studying, take some time to think of why.  You might be learning too many topics you feel that you SHOULD know and not what you want to know.  You might be spending too much time on learning in your limited schedule.  You might even not be sleeping enough or might not be releasing stress in a healthy way.  Regardless, please make sure you are enjoying the things you learn with Incremental Learning.  Once you solve that problem, with enough time the amount of things you can learn will amaze you.</p>
