    <h2>Incremental Learning</h2>
    <small>2020-06-18</small>
    <p>During my school years I forgot how to learn.  I lost the ability to teach myself.</p>
    <p>Each year, I felt I was on an obsessive treadmill.  During the school year, I looked forward to the weekend or vacation.  When on vacation, I binged on video games or television until boredom set in.  Once bored, I looked forward to learning or exploring.</p>
    <p>By the time I entered this stage, my vacation was over and I went back on a school schedule, having forgotten most of what I learned the prior year.</p>
    <p>There was no way out.</p>
    <p>Have you ever felt a sense of creeping dread about your future? A feeling you forgot to do something important or that you don't have any skills to succeed in the world? I spent many a plan-less Friday night grappling with a mixed cocktail of anxiety with a dash of desire to go wild with my friends at the weekend party.</p>
    <p>The whole world was passing me by and there was nothing I could do to stop it.</p>
    <h3>A New Problem</h3>
    <p>After high school I joined the military to learn Chinese.  I wanted to learn a long-term skill, and spent nearly every waking moment focusing on the subject.</p>
    <p>As I progressed, I encountered another problem.  No matter how often I studied, I would forget fundamentals I had previously learned. I was shocked even further when a substitute Chinese teacher complained that after studying for decades, there were some characters she "just couldn't remember".</p> 
    <p>The relization that people who had been learning Chinese for much longer than me continued to feel the same memory anxiety ate at me. I was investing a large portion of my life learning.  If the knowledge I gained would disappear after a few years of disuse, what was the point?</p>
    // I HAVE EDITED UNTIL HERE
    <p>As an aside, there is a Buddhist principle hidden in my experience.  Everything is ephemeral, so there is no use in trying to keep things the same.  Although this is true, I find something poetic in fighting nature in order to achieve a human goal.  I fought nature often during those first years of obsessive study. It was because of that fight that I was able to understand the power of incremental learning when I encountered it.</p>
    <p>I later learned the anxiety stemmed from an issue that is prevalent in subjects that require a large proportion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a>. Declarative knowledge is knowledge that can be described in words. This includes facts, trivia, vocabulary words, and the answers to Jeopardy questions.</p>
    <p>Declarative knowledge also includes explicitly knowing a specific computer algorithm implementation or being able to describe why you should or shouldn't invest in bitcoin.  Regardless of how much you learn, without sufficient review you will forget it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">Procedural knowledge</a> tends to stick in the brain for longer, and is a natural side effect of performing skills for long periods of time.</p>
    <p>This phenomenon of forgetting declarative knowledge is why most classes in school require review at the beginning of each new semester and why people feel they didn't learn anything in high school (myself included).  Fortunately, in the past 150 years, a few people have researched how the brain forgets declarative knowledge and discovered that it happens on a predictable interval.  When you study individual pieces of information using these intervals, you can increase the amount of time these facts stay in your memory.  In the 80s, a couple of Polish Computer Science graduate students had the idea to write a computer program to schedule the intervals at which to review this information and bring the information back to be reviewed. The first version of their program became the first Spaced Repetition System (or SRS).</p> 
    <p>I was introduced to using a SRS to study by a great friend of mine.  I still use the software to learn to this day.  The invention of the SRS bred techniques and research that enable you to prioritize and plan your learn so that you can meet your target goals while enjoying the process.</p>
    <h3>What is Incremental Learning?</h3>
    <p>Incremental Learning is a method of learning that helps a student convert learning material into durable memories.  Taking advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>, a student is reminded of specific pieces of information at points of time when they are most beneficial to the consolidation of long-term memory. Each time a card is presented to them, the student can make a decision as to how important this information is to their future goals and processes the information accordingly.  Information is incrementally whittled into a testable format, either a question and answer pair or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze deletion</a>.</p>
    <p>The full process of incremental learning from article to processed cards occurs in a few steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1. Inserting full articles into your spaced repetition application of choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2. Taking an action each time the article is presented.  An action can be deleting text you deem not important for your long-term memory, saving an important section of a text into a separate card, or immediately creating a testable card.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3. Whittling the pieces of text down to simple, active recall-based memories. Once a card is only comprised of one active recall-based memory, you can transform it into a format that requires testing yourself in order to pass the card.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It might not sound like much, but there is incredible benefit to learning on a spaced schedule.  Even if the action you take on a card is only to incrementally break down an article, since you are reading the material on an optimal interval, there is a deeper impression of the material left on your brain. Eventually, familiarity with the text will enable you to condense your understanding into question answer pairs or cloze deletions.  By this time, the active recall card you create will be lodged in your long-term memory and the interval on which you need to review it will slowly increase to a period of time that surpasses your lifetime.</p>
    <p>While using the program, each time you encounter specific articles on a topic you can make a decision on how important this text is to your overall knowledge.  This allows you to make decisions about how important this material is each time you process a card. As you process articles that are full of unfamiliar information, you can focus in on prerequisite vocabulary or concepts and look up related articles / add those to your supermemo process.  Oftentimes a failure to understand an article you are presented with occurs due to a lack of prerequisite knowledge or the way in which an author writes about the topic.  With incremental learning, we can add many different articles on the same topic and benefit from many people explaining the same phenomenon. The interruption of the reading process allows us to make decisions on what information we need to add or what topics are unclear each step of the way. Reading descriptions of a topic and its prerequisite knowledge written by multiple authors broadens our mental models on a topic and deepens our understanding.</p>
    <p>The advantages of Incremental Learning are discussed <a href="https://super-memory.com/archive/help16/advantages.htm#Advantages">elsewhere</a>. Using incremental learning is not without its challenges.</p>
    <h3>The Challenge of Prioritization</h3>
    <p>For the longest time, I tried to remember everything with Incremental Learning, from ancient Chinese to Chinese poems to some Japanese.</p>
    <p>While these topics are beneficial to a Chinese Literature researcher or a foreign cultural expert, they did not serve my goals in life. After clarifying my direction in life, I mass deleted articles, cards, and notes that were no longer relevant to my life.</p>
    <p>Investing in Incremental learning enables you to not worry about missing a piece of information or forgetting an important fact. Since you are able to consciously choose the information you remember, prioritization becomes key. As long as you show up, prioritize, and add relevant materials, your understanding of a subject will gradually deepen under your conscious control.</p>
    <p>If you don't know what your goals are yet, don't worry. Massive learning with SRS enables you to be more aware of what happens in your life and certain phenomenon across topics based on your interest.  As you learn more about the world and yourself, your interests will begin to crystallize and what you really enjoy and desire will become clearer with time.  My journey to maturity has been a slow one that involved changing fields and jobs multiple times.  With enough time and good learning, you will find yourself moving in a direction of greater fulfillment and productivity.</p>
    <h3>A Large Investment</h3>
    <p>Most people quit using Incremental Learning due to the consistency required to benefit from the program.  Like opening up your day planner after summer break to find out you forgot to do all of your summer homework, opening up your favorite SRS after a couple of days to see a pile of cards due feels like a massive soul crush. Using Incremental Learning to power your studying requires acquiring a new habit.  To obtain maximum benefits, you must do your cards daily.  You don't need to always finish, but the method works best if you make it a habit you perform every single day.</p>
    <p>{There are ways to minimize the amount of times you are immersed in a deluge of review cards. When many people start on the journey, they add tons of cards to their collections and force themselves to adjust from spending no time studying in this manner to studying hours a day.  It is easy to burn out when you try to go from 0 - 100 in a new habit, and I almost quit doing cards because of this many times in the past.  Most Spaced Repetition programs have a method to limit the amount of reviews you do a day.  If you find yourself drowning in reviews, it is best to limit reviews to a number that is manageable in your schedule.  It is better to push yourself a little bit outside of your comfort zone daily than a lot outside of your comfort zone weekly.  Eventually you will adapt to a certain load and will need to push harder in order to feel the same sense of exertion.}</p>
    <p>Using Incremental Learning daily will supercharge your life, work, and interests in knowledge.  The process <b>takes time</b>.</p>
    <h3>Remember</h3>
    <p>The best learning in life comes with a sense of pleasure.  This sense of reward is provided by the brain itself and is the ultimately indication of healthy, sustainable learning.  If you feel like you are struggling or not enjoying your studying, take some time to discover why.  You might be learning too many topics you think you SHOULD know and not what you want to know.  You might be spending too much time learning on your limited schedule.}</p>  
    <p>You might even not be sleeping enough or might not be resolving stress in a healthy way.  Regardless, look to resolve these issues one at a time and make sure you are enjoying the learning process.  Learning for fun won't happen all at once. But when you can learn with pleasure, you will be amazed at the amount of and quality of knowledge you can learn.</p>
