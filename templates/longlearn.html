    <h2>Incremental Learning</h2>
    <small>2020-06-18</small>
    <p>During my school years I forgot how to learn.  I lost the ability to teach myself.</p>
    <p>Each year I felt like I was on some kind of obsessive treadmill.  While school was in, I looked forward to the weekend or vacation.  When vacation happened, I binged on video games or television until boredom set in.  Once bored, I looked forward to learning or exploring.  I never found a way out.</p>
    <p>After a bit of time, I thought something was wrong with me.  My life wasn't as hopeful or accomplished as my peers.  Have you ever felt a creeping sense of dread that you forgot to do something important?  That was how I felt often. I spent many a plan-less Friday night grappling with this feeling while also wanting to enjoy the freedom of the weekend.  It felt like the whole world was passing me by and there was nothing I could do to stop it. </p>
    <h3>A New Problem</h3>
    <p>After high school I joined the military and began studying Chinese.  The sense of dread due to lack of purpose was gone.  It was replaced with another negative feeling.  Even though I spent a lot of time studying and learning, I noticed that things I had previously learned I would forget.  A substitute Chinese teacher even complained that after studying for decades, characters she knew she could recognize before would often slip from her mind.  There is an anxiety in subjects that require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a>. Regardless of how much you learn, without sufficient review you will forget it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">Procedural knowledge</a> tends to stick in the brain for longer, and is a natural side effect of performing skills for long periods of time.</p>
    <p>This phenomenon of forgetting is why most classes in school require review at the beginning of each new semester and why people feel they didn't learn anything in high school (myself included).  Fortunately, in the past 150 years, a few people have researched how the brain forgets declarative knowledge and discovered that we forget on a predictable interval.  When you study individual pieces of information using these intervals, you can increase the amount of time these facts stay in your memory.  Later, a couple of Polish Computer Science graduate students had the idea to write a computer to schedule the intervals at which to review this information. Their 30-year long labor became the first Spaced Repetition System (or SRS).</p> 
    <p>I was introduced to using a SRS to study by a great friend of mine.  I still use the software to learn to this day.  However, just using the software to learn isn't enough.  You also have to learn how to learn incrementally for maximum benefit (and pleasure).</p>
    <h3>What is Incremental Learning?</h3>
    <p>Incremental Learning can be defined as a method of learning that helps a student convert all forms of learning material into durable memories.  Taking advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>, a student is reminded of specific pieces of information at points of time when they are most beneficial to the consolidation of long-term memory. Each time a card is presented to them, the student can make a decision as to how important this information is to their future goals and processes the information accordingly.  Information is incrementally whittled into a testable format, either a question and answer pair or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze deletion</a>.</p>
    <p>The full process of incremental learning from article to processed cards occurs in a few steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1. Inserting full articles into your spaced repetition application of choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2. Taking an action each time the article is presented.  An action can be deleting text you deem not important for your long-term memory, saving important section of into a separate card, or immediately creating a testable card if the information can be easily processed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3. Whittling the pieces of text down to simple, active recall-based memories. Once a card is only comprised of one active recall-based memory, you can transform it into a format that requires testing yourself in order to pass the card.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It might not sound like much, but there is incredible benefit to learning on a spaced schedule.  Even if this learning is only done by incrementally breaking down an article. If you only read pieces of an article at a time, you will remember more of the whole text than it seems.  As you break the article into smaller chunks, you allow your brain to store this information in your long-term memory.  Eventually, familiarity with the text will enable you to condense your understanding into question answer pairs or cloze deletions.  By this time, this active recall card will be lodged in your long-term memory and the interval on which you need to review it will increase slowly.</p>
    <p>Each time you encounter specific articles on a topic in your reviews, you can make a decision on how important this text is to your overall knowledge of a topic.  A failure to understand a topic can also happen due to the format in which it is written. With incremental learning, we can add many different articles on the same topic and benefit from many people explaining the same phenomenon. This works to improve our mental models of a topic through reading many different authors' takes on the topic.</p>
    <p>The advantages of Incremental Learning are discussed <a href="https://super-memory.com/archive/help16/advantages.htm#Advantages">elsewhere</a>. In the next section {I'd like to share difficulties I've encountered during the process.}</p>
    <h3>The Challenge of Prioritization</h3>
    <p>Incremental learning takes time.  It is also speculated that if the rate of learning is constant, the amount of information we can actually learn has a biological limit.  Regardless of whether this is proven true, We must be selective to what we decide to keep stored in our long-term memory.</p>
    <p>For the longest time, I tried to remember everything with Incremental Learning, from ancient Chinese to Chinese poems to some Japanese.</p>
    <p>While these topics are beneficial to a Chinese Literature researcher or a foreign cultural expert in that specific region, they did not serve my goals in life. After my clarified my direction in life, I began to systematically delete articles, cards, and notes that were no longer relevant to my life.</p>
    <p>Investing in Incremental learning enables you to not worry about missing a piece of information or forgetting an important fact.  As long as you show up, prioritize, and add relevant materials, your understanding of a subject will gradually deepen under your conscious control.</p>
    <h3>A Large Investment</h3>
    <p>Incremental Learning is not without its difficulties.  Using Incremental Learning to power your studying requires acquiring a new habit.  To obtain maximum benefits, you must do your cards daily.  You don't need to always finish, but the method works best if you make it a habit you perform every single day.</p>
    <p>When many people start on the journey, they add tons of cards to their collections and force themselves to go from spending no time studying in this manner to studying hours a day.  It is easy to burn out working this way, and I almost quit doing cards because of this many times in my past.  Most Spaced Repetition programs have a method to limit the amount of reviews you do a day.  If you find yourself drowning in reviews, it is best to limit reviews to a number that is manageable in your schedule.  It is better to push yourself a little bit outside of your comfort zone daily than a lot outside of your comfort zone weekly.  Eventually you will adapt to a certain load and will need to push harder in order to feel the same sense of exertion.</p>
    <p>Using Incremental Learning daily will supercharge your life, work, and interests in knowledge.  However, it takes time.</p>
    <h3>Remember</h3>
    <p>The best learning in life comes with a sense of pleasure.  If you feel like you are struggling or not enjoying your studying, take some time to discover why.  You might be learning too topics you you SHOULD know and not what you want to know.  You might be spending too much time learning in your limited schedule.  You might even not be sleeping enough or might not be resolving stress in a healthy way.  Regardless, make sure you are enjoying the learning process.  Learning for fun won't happen all at once.  .But when you can learn with pleasure, you will be amazed at amount you can learn.</p>
