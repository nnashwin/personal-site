        <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
        <h3>A Long Break</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of February I took vacation from my job at X big software company to have my daughter.  Around that time the coronavirus started picking up in the US.  I was planning on returning in December, but I am now staying in Taiwan for the next year or so.</p>
        <h3>My Day to Day</h3>
        <p>I usually wake up around 12-1 and do some <a href="/longlearn">incremental learning</a>.  After anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour I finish and begin working on programming projects.</p>
        <p>Some of these projects have been open sourced and some are with friends.</p>
        <p>After 3-4 hours, I plan dinner and either moped to my wife's parents house or cook something at home.  After dinner I'll spend time with her family, workout, or just wind down for the day.  After my wife and daughter go to sleep, I usually either do some more incremental learning or work on programming projects.</p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>I am working on a tool to help people strengthen their relationships. I'm also collaborating with a university in the states and a startup I used to work at in Taiwan.</p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>I am already accustomed to living in Taiwan again, so I have reverted back to not reading much Chinese besides Incremental Learning and living in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>My daughter still enjoys silly voices, sounds, and faces. I do this quite a bit today.  I'm spending time working on personal projects, consulting, exercising, and learning.</p>
        <p>I am currently open for consulting work.</p>
