        <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
        <h3>A Long Break</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of February I took vacation from my job at X big software company to have my daughter.  Around that time the coronavirus started picking up in the US.  I am currently renting an apartment in Taiwan and planning to return to the US in December.  In the meantime, I am working on projects, meeting new people, visiting old friends and exercising as much as I can while taking care of my daughter.</p>
        <h3>Daily Routine</h3>
        <p>I usually wake up around 12-1 and do some <a href="/longlearn">incremental learning</a>.  After anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour I finish and begin working on programming projects.</p>
        <p>Some of these projects have been open sourced and some are with friends.</p>
        <p>After 3-4 hours, I walk over to my wife's family's house and eat dinner.  After dinner I'll spend time with her family, workout, and just wind down with them for the day.  After my wife and daughter go to sleep, I usually either do some more incremental learning or work on programming projects.</p>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I have recently been working on putting up this site and creating content for it.  I have still been working on the egg timer with some of the extra time I have.</p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>It's been a few years since I've been in Taiwan, so I have been trying to utilize the Chinese environment and read more Chinese books.  I'm currently reading the Three Body Problem (三體) and have been following some Japanese manga translated into Chinese.</p>
        <p>My daughter likes it when I talk in silly voices to her, so I do that as much as possible.  I have been playing the game Baldur's Gate during my offtime.  I have been wanting to complete it since since third grade, so I am excited to finally play through and see something that inspired me as a child to completion.</p>
