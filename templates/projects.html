        <h3>Currently Unnamed Timer App</h3>
        <p>I enjoy using a modified pomodoro method to inform me when I should take a break.  I searched around for a bit and didn't find any cross-platform apps where I could choose the amount of time and add an audio clip that would play at the end of the timer.</p>
        <p>The application is built in electron and Typescript for static types.  I wrote a custom build-script and am working on packaging for the application.</p>

        <h3>Golang Interview</h3>
        <p>An ongoing project I use to implement and discuss my learning process of computer science algorithms and data structures. I have a non-traditional CS background, so this combined with incremental learning has enabled me to explore and learn different ways to efficiently solve problems.</p>

        <h3>Automated API Testing</h3>
        <p>Worked with api team to analyze which tasks QA tested repeatedly each day and explored the related api calls through the front end.  After discussing our approach, I created a suite of automated api tests to run nightly to supplement manual testing.  Configured CircleCI build job to run nightly and added Glip integration to inform the team of the tests' status.</p>
        <p>Technologies used: NodeJS, Newman, Postman, CircleCI, cronjob</p>
