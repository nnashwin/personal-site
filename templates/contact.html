    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <h3>Non-business related</h3>
    <p>I love getting to know new people.  Please email me at <a href="mailto:tyler@tylerboright.com">tyler@tylerboright.com</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
    <p>There are two reasons for this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1. We can exchange life stories and bond through the internet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2. Through the process of connecting, we can build our network and introduce each other to people we should meet.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I reply to <b>all</b> emails.</p>
    <h3>Business</h3>
    <p>I'm currently available for consulting and freelancing (there is a difference).</p> 
    <p>My main expertise lies in full stack web development, cloud management, Javascript and Golang.</p>
